## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my capabilities in both front-end and back-end development, focusing on Python (Django) and React. The application allows users to send interest messages to other users, accept or reject these messages, and if accepted, chat with each other in real-time.

## Core Features
### User Authentication:
Registration and login functionality.
### Sending Interests:
Logged-in users can browse a list of other users and send an interest message.
### Accepting/Rejecting Interests:
Users can view received interest messages and accept or reject them.
### Chat System:
If an interest is accepted, a chat interface is enabled where both users can send and receive messages in real-time.
